# OS Installation

I downloaded the [Raspbian distribution](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and wrote it on my microSD Card.
I am using Ubuntu 15.04.

 1. I unzipped the downloaded archive:
 
 ```sh
 $ unzip 2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.zip 
 Archive:  2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.zip
   inflating: 2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.img 
 ```
 
 2. Inserted the card into my laptop and formated it as fat32:

 3. Right click and open with Disk Writter:

 4. Clicked the <kbd>Start Restoring</kbd> button.

 5. Waited until the image was written.

 6. Umounted and unplugged the card from my machine and inserted it in the pi.
 7. Connected a HDMI monitor and my mini keyboard and started the pi.

## Configuring the Raspberry Pi

 1. When starting it shows some logs on the screen then a nice gray box appear on blue background.
 2. I changed my user password in something better than the default one (`raspberry`).
 3. I set it to boot to Desktop (GUI).
 4. Changed the keyboard layout (to use *Romanian*–so I can use diacritics like ă, â, ș, ț, î)
 5. Changed some advanced options:
   - Enabled SSH
   - Enabled SPI (I need that for making the display work later)
 6. Rebooted the pi.

## Things I did after install

 1. I installed VIM: `sudo apt-get install vim`–it is the editor I feel the most comfortable.
 2. I edited the [`/boot/config.txt` to remove the HDMI black boders](/troubles/hdmi-black-borders.md).
 3. Installed `sl`–so I can have some fun with terminal animations.
 4. Changed the appearance of the desktop to something I liked more.
 5. `sudo apt-get install hdparm`–I use this tool to test the sdcard speed
 6. `sudo apt-get install chromium-browser`–currently, using Chromium :dizzy:
