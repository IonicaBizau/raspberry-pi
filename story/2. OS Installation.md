# OS Installation

I downloaded the [Raspbian distribution](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and wrote it on my microSD Card.
I am using Ubuntu 15.04.

 1. I unzipped the downloaded archive:
 
 ```sh
 $ unzip 2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.zip 
 Archive:  2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.zip
   inflating: 2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.img 
 ```
 
 2. Inserted the card into my laptop and formated it as fat32:

 3. Right click and open with Disk Writter:

 4. Clicked the <kbd>Start Restoring</kbd> button.

 5. Waited until the image was written.
