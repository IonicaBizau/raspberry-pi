# LCD Screen Drivers Installation

I installed the drivers for my LCD display. If yours is different you have to install other drivers.

 - Dowloaded [the driver](http://www.spotpear.com/download/diver24-5/LCD-show-150602.tar.gz)
 - Extracted the files (`tar xvf LCD-show.tar.gz`)
 - `cd LCD-show/ `
 - `sudo ./LCD35-show` (this depends on the display size, mine is 3.5")

:warning: After this HDMI monitor will stop working. See [HDMI & LCD together](/troubles/hdmi-lcd-together.md).
